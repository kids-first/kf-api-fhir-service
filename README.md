FHIR data service for NCPI uses the [Smile CDR FHIR server](https://smilecdr.com/docs/).

## Quickstart

NCPI FHIR services have been deployed into the three standard environments
within the NCPI AWS account: Dev, QA, Prd.

The FHIR endpoints for these are:

### Production
https://ncpi-api-fhir-service.kidsfirstdrc.org

### QA
https://ncpi-api-fhir-service-qa.kidsfirstdrc.org

### Dev
https://ncpi-api-fhir-service-dev.kidsfirstdrc.org

## ðŸš§ Server Access ðŸš§

**NOTE: We recognize that the process for accessing the deployed servers is not
very user/developer friendly. This is temporary as we are still working on the
NCPI infrastructure and server authentication. Please bear with us!**

### Two Layer Authentication
In order to interact with the FHIR servers in any of the environments, you
will need to go through two levels of authentication:

1. Authenticate to gain access to the server's environment
2. Authenticate with the server to gain access to the server's data

### Access Instructions

#### Request Access

You will do these steps only one time.

1. In a browser, go to the server URL

    Make sure you are signed out of any Google accounts

    Example: `https://ncpi-api-fhir-service-dev.kidsfirstdrc.org`

2. Click `Login with Google` and try to sign in with a Google account

3. You will get a page with a `401 Not Authorized`

4. Send an email to [Alex Lubneuski](mailto:LUBNEUSKIA@EMAIL.CHOP.EDU)
and [Natasha Singh](mailto:singhn4@email.chop.edu) or a
Slack message in the NCPI `#fhir-wg` channel with the Google account you used before.

5. You will receive an email with confirmation of the access

#### Authenticate to Access Server Environment

You will do this every time Cookie expires (~1 week)

1. Repeat steps 1-2 above
2. If successful, you will see a page from the server that says:

 `This is the base URL of FHIR server.` under the `Response Body` section.

3. Save the cookie from the response

   The cookie can be found in the response's `Cookie` header.

#### Authenticate with Server

You will do this every time you want to send HTTP requests to any of the
NCPI FHIR servers.

The NCPI FHIR server currently uses basic authentication on almost every
endpoint (except `/endpoint-health`). When you make a request to the server,
you will need to:

- Include your basic authentication credentials in the `Authorization` header
- Include your cookie in the `Cookie` header

Example:

```
curl -u username:password --cookie <the cookie> https://ncpi-api-fhir-service-dev.kidsfirstdrc.org/Patient
```

## Development

You can experiment locally with the FHIR Docker Compose stack. The services/apps
included in this are:

- Smile CDR FHIR services (See [Endpoints](#Endpoints) below)
- PostgresSQL database for the server
- FHIR Data Dashboard web app

### Spin up the Docker Stack

1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:kids-first/ncpi-api-fhir-service.git
cd ncpi-api-fhir-service
```

2. Get access to the Smile CDR image

    - Create a [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) account if you don't have
      one
    - Ask singhn4@email.chop.edu for access to the image
      (hosted in private Docker Hub repo)

    **Do not distribute the Smile CDR image as it is only for trial use by the
    internal team**

3. Set environment variables in a `.env` file (See `server/settings/dev.env` for example)

**Note:**

The `run_local_server.sh` script requires Docker Hub credentials. First it will look for
the environment variables `DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_HUB_PW`. If either of
these are not set then it will try to source them from the `.env` file.

4. Deploy server and load [NCPI FHIR model](https://github.com/kids-first/ncpi-api-fhir-service) into server

```bash
# Deploy server
./scripts/run_local_server.sh

# Load model into server
./scripts/load_model.sh
```

You could also run the steps in `run_local_server.sh` manually. It is just a convenience
script which does some setup and then runs `docker-compose up -d`.

### Endpoints

#### [FHIR Data Dashboard](https://github.com/kids-first/kf-ui-fhir-data-dashboard)

A data browser app intended to give users a quick overview of the data in the
FHIR server along with the ability to filter FHIR resources and drill down to
view specific resources.
- http://localhost:3000

#### [FHIR API](https://smilecdr.com/docs/tutorial_and_tour/fhir_crud_operations.html)

- The main endpoint ingest developers will use to CRUD FHIR resources
- http://localhost:8000

#### [Smile CDR Admin API](https://smilecdr.com/docs/fhir_repository/fhirweb_console.html)

- The administration endpoint used to change server configuration, user settings, etc.
- http://localhost:9000

#### [Smile CDR Admin Dashboard](https://smilecdr.com/docs/modules/web_admin_console.html)

- The administration dashboard which is essentially a frontend to the admin API
- http://localhost:9100

### Start/Stop the Stack

```bash
# Stop all services
docker-compose stop

# Start all services
docker-compose start
```

### View Service Logs

Once the services are running you can view logs from all services:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

### Reload NCPI FHIR Model
Run the loader script to reload (DELETE and POST) the NCPI FHIR
conformance resources.

The conformance resources are sourced from the `ncpi-api-fhir-service` git repository.
The default branch that is used for loading is `master`, but you can supply a
different branch if you want.

This script will always do a `git pull` to update the branch before loading
the resources. This might result in merge errors if you have made changes
to the local branch which you will need to resolve (or do a complete wipe out
`git reset --hard origin/<branch>`)


```bash
./scripts/load_model.sh some-other-branch
```

### Server Settings

**Properties File**

Server settings are controlled by modifying the
`server/settings/master.properties` Java properties file.

The property strings in the file represent a hierarchical structure of
config modules in the Smile CDR. Each module pertains to a logical set of
functionality (e.g. persistence) in the server. Read more about the config modules
[here](https://smilecdr.com/docs/json_admin_endpoints/module_config_endpoint.html)

**Environment Variable Substitution**

Property values in the properties file may also be passed in from the
environment using the [environment variable substitution expressions](https://smilecdr.com/docs/installation/installing_smile_cdr.html#variable-substitution).
This is useful for passing in secrets like DB credentials.

**NOTE**

Any settings changed and saved via the Smile CDR Admin Dashboard or the
Smile CDR Admin API will be discarded every time the server is re-deployed.
This is because the source of truth for the settings is the properties file
and NOT the database. However, this behavior can be changed with the
[node.propertysource property](https://smilecdr.com/docs/installation/installing_smile_cdr.html#module-property-source).
